    title: "Demystifying React Hooks: A Practical Guide",
    excerpt:
      "React Hooks revolutionized functional components. This guide breaks down the most common hooks with practical examples.",
    content: `
      <p>React Hooks have fundamentally changed how we write React components, allowing us to use state and other React features in functional components without writing a class. This has led to cleaner, more readable, and often more performant code.</p>
      <h2>useState</h2>
      <p>The <code>useState</code> hook allows you to add state to functional components. It returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.</p>
      <pre><code>import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You clicked {count} times&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}&gt;
        Click me
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}</code></pre>
      <h2>useEffect</h2>
      <p>The <code>useEffect</code> hook lets you perform side effects in functional components. It's a close replacement for <code>componentDidMount</code>, <code>componentDidUpdate</code>, and <code>componentWillUnmount</code>.</p>
      <pre><code>import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function TitleUpdater() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = \`You clicked \${count} times\`;
  }, [count]); // Only re-run if count changes

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You clicked {count} times&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}&gt;
        Click me
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}</code></pre>
      <p>There are many more hooks like <code>useContext</code>, <code>useReducer</code>, <code>useCallback</code>, and <code>useMemo</code>, each serving a specific purpose to make your React development more efficient and enjoyable.</p>

    title: "CSS Grid vs. Flexbox: When to Use Which?",
    excerpt:
      "Confused about CSS Grid and Flexbox? This post clarifies their strengths and helps you decide the best tool for your layout needs.",
    content: `
      <p>CSS Grid and Flexbox are both powerful layout modules in CSS, but they are designed for different purposes. Understanding when to use each is key to building robust and responsive web designs.</p>
      <h2>Flexbox: One-Dimensional Layout</h2>
      <p>Flexbox is ideal for laying out items in a single dimensionâ€”either a row or a column. It excels at distributing space among items in a container and aligning them.</p>
      <p>Use Flexbox for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigation bars</li>
        <li>Components with dynamic content alignment</li>
        <li>Distributing items evenly within a single line</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>CSS Grid: Two-Dimensional Layout</h2>
      <p>CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, meaning it can handle both rows and columns simultaneously. It's perfect for creating complex page layouts.</p>
      <p>Use CSS Grid for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Overall page layouts (header, sidebar, main content, footer)</li>
        <li>Complex component layouts that require precise positioning in both dimensions</li>
        <li>Creating responsive designs with explicit grid areas</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In many modern web applications, you'll find yourself using both. Grid for the macro layout of the page, and Flexbox for the micro layout of elements within those grid areas.</p>
